# Introduction

![](education.jpg)


We chose education as our research topic because both of us are passionate about educational equity. Furthermore, Dillon is originally from New York City and attended a NYC public school, and he thought it would be interesting to learn more about the same school system that was an integral part of his academic journey. 

We are especially interested in exploring the intersections of race/ethnicity, disability status, income, and English language learner status with standardized test scores. Standardized testing is extremely important because it has an impact on funding, which directly influences a child’s experience in school. However, these tests are often criticized for favoring some students based on the aforementioned factors. We hope to look through this data and find more insights into whether or not there is any relationship between student performance and student demographics/the demographics of a student’s school or district.
