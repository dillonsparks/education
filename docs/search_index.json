Furthermore, Dillon is originally from New York City and attended a NYC public school, and he thought it would be interesting to learn more about the school system that was an integral part of his academic journey. We are especially interested in exploring the intersections of race/ethnicity, disability status, income, gender, and English language learner status with standardized test scores. Standardized testing is extremely important because it has an impact on funding, which directly influences a child’s experience in school. However, these tests are often criticized for favoring some students based on the aforementioned factors. We hope to look through this data and find more insights into whether or not there is any relationship between student performance and student demographics/the demographics of a student’s school. 2.2 Data availability (Standardized testing scores) https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/test-results (ELA Test Results 2013-2022, and Math Test result 2013-2022) For this project, we will be utilizing three datasets: two that include standardized test scores from the New York Department of Education InfoHub and another with student demographics from the NYC DOE. The first two datasets contain English Language Arts (ELA) and math test scores between 2013 and 2022 from students in 3rd grade to 8th grade at every school. Each year, the Department of Education (DOE) shares test results in hopes of helping “families and educators understand the performance of New York City schools” (NYC InfoHub). Data regarding test results is available at the city, borough, district, and school levels. For this project, we will examine test results at the school level. A key feature of these datasets is they include the characteristics of each student regarding disability status, English Language Learner (ELL) status, race/ethnicity and gender. The data is updated yearly, however does not include test scores from 2020 and 2021 since exams were not administered or optional due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its format is tabular, thus it can be exported as a spreadsheet or CSV file. The dataset also includes important information such as the number of students tested, mean scale score, and the level at which each student tested. This dataset is highly credible given that it comes from the DOE. (Student demographics by School) https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/school-quality/information-and-data-overview This dataset was also collected by the New York City Department of Education (NYC DOE) and it includes various information about a student’s demographics, including race, gender, English language learner status, income, and much more. It was collected using the student’s information once they entered the NYC public school system. Due to differences in the timing of when student demographic, address and census data were pulled, ENI (Economic Need Index) values may vary (2017-18 - 2021-22 Demographic Snapshot). The format of the data is tabular, it can be exported as an excel spreadsheet or CSV file. The data was last updated June 15, 2022. Some additional information about the dataset is that the “New York State Education Department begins administering assessments to be identified as an English Language Learner (ELL) in Kindergarten, but students in Pre-K are still included in the denominator for the ELL calculations” (2017-18 - 2021-22 Demographic Snapshot). Pre-K students also do not receive NYC DOE School food, however are included in the poverty calculations. We plan to import the data by downloading the two separate datasets, reading them into RStudio, and then aggregating them based on school. From there, we will filter out the years that are not included in all three datasets, so we will end up with all of the demographic data and math/ELA test scores for each school from grades 3-8, between 2018-2019 and 2021-2022.

The “_m” suffix corresponds to a Math score, and the “_e” suffix corresponds to an ELA score Joining datasets (one for school, one for district) Adding a new column in each dataframe that shows the percentage of students in a given district/school who sat for testing in a given year Getting rid of unnecessary columns in each of the combined dataframes Getting rid of the “Above 95%” entries in each dataframe- replacing it with 0.95 for the sake of analysis. Then converting numeric columns to numeric again Imputing all missing values with the mean of the column; too many rows/columns to create a heatmap so we will just impute them with the mean value for each category and analyze the other missing values later ## Mean Scale Score_e Mean Scale Score_m ## 1 1 ## DBN Year ## 0 0 ## Total Enrollment % Asian ## 0 0 ## % Black % Hispanic ## 0 0 ## % Multi-Racial % Native American ## 0 0 ## % White % Missing Race/Ethnicity Data ## 0 0 ## % Students with Disabilities % English Language Learners ## 0 0 ## % Poverty Economic Need Index ## 0 0 ## % tested_e % tested_m ## 0 0 ## District Year ## 0 0 ## Mean Scale Score_e Mean Scale Score_m ## 0 0 ## Total Enrollment % Asian ## 0 0 ## % Black % Hispanic ## 0 0 ## % Multi-Racial % Native American ## 0 0 ## % White % Missing Race/Ethnicity Data ## 0 0 ## % Students with Disabilities % English Language Learners ## 0 0 ## % Poverty Economic Need Index ## 0 0 ## % tested_e % tested_m ## 0 0 Creating a % POC column (that sums all of the other races) for racial analysis of data Renaming specific columns for visibility in plots Writing two new csv’s so we don’t have to touch any of the old dataframes/csv’s anymore 3.3 Missing value analysis Importing data.

Using skim(), it returned that there were 0 missing values in the dataset, however the missing values are accounted for in the school and district datasets via the “% Missing Race/Ethnicity” columns. Our approach is to look for missing values by filtering the “% Missing Race/Ethnicity” column and looking at the percentage of missing data. First we will find the minimum and maximum values for missing data in this column to determine the range of missing race/ethnicity data. Using the min() and max() functions, we discovered that the percent of missing data lies between 0% and ~ 6.7% for the school dataset and 0.09% and 2.4% for the district dataset. It’s good to note that the district data doesn’t have a large number of missing values because districts are comprised of schools and data has to be reported to the district each school belongs in. If a large amount of district data was missing, we’d have to question where the school data went. ## [1] 0 ## [1] 0.06687898 ## [1] 0.0009401308 ## [1] 0.02372761 Before using data visualization methods, we thought it’d be important to look at the missing data in intervals of 0.2 for the school data. We found that: - 2421 rows in the school dataset have no missing values. - 864 rows in the school dataset have between 0% and 2% missing data. - 36 rows in the school dataset have between 2% and 4% missing data. - 4 rows in the school dataset have between 4% and 6% missing data. - 3 rows in the school dataset have more than 6% missing data. ## n ## 1 2421 ## n ## 1 864 ## n ## 1 36 ## n ## 1 4 ## n ## 1 3 For the district data, we thought it’d be nice to look at it by intervals of 0.005. We found that: - 0 rows in the district dataset have no missing values. - 61 rows in the district dataset have between 0% and 0.5% missing data. - 26 rows in the district dataset have between 0.5% and 1% missing data. - 8 rows in the district dataset have between 1% and 1.5% missing data. - 0 rows in the district dataset have between 1.5% and 2% missing data. - 1 row in the district has over 2% missing data. ## n ## 1 0 ## n ## 1 61 ## n ## 1 26 ## n ## 1 8 ## n ## 1 0 ## n ## 1 1 For our exploratory data analysis of the missing data, we decided to use a histogram. Histograms are good because they’re able to show frequency distributions. We found that the data was right-skewed. We can conclude from the visualization that majority of the schools are not missing data as it relates to racial and ethnic demographic data. This was also shown in our preliminary process, where we noted 2421 rows were not missing data, which is roughly 73% of our dataset.The remaining 27% of the data was missing about 6.7% of data, which is not too bad. Ridgeline plot for district by the amount of students that tested. The ridgeline plots look at the percentage of students that tested in Math and ELA by district from the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2021-2022 academic years. Originally, we wanted to facet the data by year and see if there were any differences across districts, however there is only one entry per year for each district, so that would not be helpful (or produce a ridgeline plot). We found that the distributions were very similar across both subjects. In neither Math or ELA was there more than 50% students tested. For districts 7 and 8, in both ELA and Math, there is some slight overlap. This means that some of the entries for those two districts may be the same or close in value. In the math scores, we can also see a very small overlap with districts 24 and 25. Both overlaps are miniscule.
