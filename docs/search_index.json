[["index.html", "Education Chapter 1 Introduction", " Education Woomy Michel and Dillon Sparks 2022-12-17 Chapter 1 Introduction We chose education as our research topic because both of us are passionate about educational equity. Furthermore, Dillon is originally from New York City and attended a NYC public school, and he thought it would be interesting to learn more about the same school system that was an integral part of his academic journey. We are especially interested in exploring the intersections of race/ethnicity, disability status, income, and English language learner status with standardized test scores. Standardized testing is extremely important because it has an impact on funding, which directly influences a child’s experience in school. However, these tests are often criticized for favoring some students based on the aforementioned factors. We hope to look through this data and find more insights into whether or not there is any relationship between student performance and student demographics/the demographics of a student’s school or district. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Our research topic focuses on the composition of the NYC school system, in addition to the factors of academic success (measured by standardized testing scores). We are aware that there are indications of a school’s ability to impact its students other than standardized testing success (or lack thereof). Anyone familiar with the NYC DOE knows that all public schools do not have the same access to resources and extracurricular activities that shape a child’s learning experience and impact exam performance. Each school in the city is a unique ecosystem that is shaped by its location, the staff/administration, the student body, and the community that surrounds it. The data that we have transformed and analyzed is meant to tell part of the story, not all of it. We hope to provide you with some preliminary insight into the makeup of the NYC public school system, which will inspire you to learn more on your own. 2.2 Data availability (Standardized testing scores) https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/test-results (ELA Test Results 2013-2022, and Math Test result 2013-2022) For this project, we will be utilizing three datasets: two that include standardized test scores from the New York Department of Education InfoHub and another with student demographics from the NYC DOE. The first two datasets contain English Language Arts (ELA) and Math test scores between 2013 and 2022 from students in 3rd grade to 8th grade at every school. Each year, the Department of Education (DOE) shares test results in hopes of helping “families and educators understand the performance of New York City schools” (NYC InfoHub). Data regarding test results is available at the city, borough, district, and school levels. For this project, we will examine test results at both the school and district levels. The data is updated yearly, however does not include test scores from 2020 and 2021 since exams were not administered or optional due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its format is tabular, thus it can be exported as a spreadsheet or CSV file. The dataset also includes important information such as the number of students tested, mean scale score for the respective subjects, and the level at which each student was tested. This dataset is highly credible given that it comes directly from the NYC DOE. (Student demographics by School) https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/school-quality/information-and-data-overview This dataset was also collected by the New York City Department of Education (NYC DOE) and it includes various information about a district’s/school’s student demographics, including race, sex assigned at birth, English language learner status, economic status, and much more. It was collected using the student’s information once they entered the NYC public school system. Due to differences in the timing of when student demographic, address, and census data were pulled, ENI (Economic Need Index) values may vary (2017-18 - 2021-22 Demographic Snapshot). The format of the data is tabular, it can be exported as an excel spreadsheet or CSV file. The data was last updated June 15, 2022. Some additional information about the dataset is that the “New York State Education Department begins administering assessments to be identified as an English Language Learner (ELL) in Kindergarten, but students in Pre-K are still included in the denominator for the ELL calculations” (2017-18 - 2021-22 Demographic Snapshot). Pre-K students also do not receive NYC DOE School food, however are included in the poverty calculations. We plan to import the data by downloading the six separate datasets, reading them into RStudio, and then joining them based on Year and either School or District (depending on which level the data was collected at). In the end we will have two new datasets, one for school and one for district, each with demographic data and math/ELA test scores for all grades 3-8, between 2017-18, 2018-2019, and 2021-2022. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources The NYC Department of Education was responsible for collecting and publishing this data. The school-level test scores were collected after they were administered and graded, and then this data was used to calculate the district-level test scores. The demographic information was collected using both the student’s information once they entered the NYC public school system, and census data. We chose to use standardized testing data from grades 3-8 over Regent’s scores (the high school equivalent of these elementary and middle school tests) because there are more middle and elementary schools in the city, and thus, more data to work with. The data was pulled from six different spreadsheets, with categorical and numerical data, with a range of 16 to 44 variables. The two largest spreadsheets had 37,000+ observations, while the smallest had only 175. The datasets did not have many issues, as there were only two missing observations in total; both were test scores for a specific school in a specific year (one Math and one ELA). However, there was a great deal of data transformation, merging, and cleaning that needed to be done in order to investigate some of the questions brought forth earlier. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Here are the various steps of the data cleaning and transformation processes, broken down into smaller tasks.

As shown above, there were 0 missing values in the dataset, however the missing values are accounted for in the school and district datasets via the “% Missing Race/Ethnicity” and “% tested_e”/“% tested_m” columns. Our approach is to start by looking for missing values by filtering the “% Missing Race/Ethnicity” column and looking at the percentage of missing data. First we will find the minimum and maximum values for missing data in this column to determine the range of missing race/ethnicity data. Using the min() and max() functions, we discovered that the percent of missing data lies between 0% and ~ 6.7% for the school dataset and 0.09% and 2.4% for the district dataset. It’s good to note that the district data doesn’t have a large number of missing values because districts are comprised of schools and data has to be reported to the district each school belongs in. If a large amount of district data was missing, we’d have to question where a bunch of the individual school data went. Before using data visualization methods, we thought it’d be important to look at the missing data in intervals of 0.2 for the school data. We found that: * 2421 rows in the school dataset have no missing values. * 864 rows in the school dataset have between 0% and 2% missing data. * 36 rows in the school dataset have between 2% and 4% missing data. * 4 rows in the school dataset have between 4% and 6% missing data. * 3 rows in the school dataset have more than 6% missing data. For the district data, we thought it’d be nice to look at it by intervals of 0.005. We found that: - 0 rows in the district dataset have no missing values. - 61 rows in the district dataset have between 0% and 0.5% missing data. - 26 rows in the district dataset have between 0.5% and 1% missing data. - 8 rows in the district dataset have between 1% and 1.5% missing data. - 0 rows in the district dataset have between 1.5% and 2% missing data. - 1 row in the district has over 2% missing data. For our exploratory data analysis of the missing testing data, we decided to use a histogram. Histograms are good because they’re able to show frequency distributions. We found that the data was right-skewed. We can conclude from the visualization that majority of the schools are not missing data as it relates to racial and ethnic demographic data. This was also shown in our preliminary process, where we noted 2421 rows were not missing data, which is roughly 73% of our dataset.The remaining 27% of the data was missing about 6.7% of data, which is not too bad. Ridgeline plot for district by the amount of students that tested. The ridgeline plots look at the percentage of students that tested in Math and ELA by district from the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2021-2022 academic years. Originally, we wanted to facet the data by year and see if there were any differences across districts, however there is only one entry per year for each district, so that would not be helpful (or produce a ridgeline plot). We found that the distributions were very similar across both subjects. In neither Math or ELA was there more than 50% students tested. For districts 7 and 8, in both ELA and Math, there is some slight overlap. This means that some of the entries for those two districts may be the same or close in value. In the math scores, we can also see a very small overlap with districts 24 and 25. Both overlaps are miniscule.

As expected, success in one subject usually came with success in the other. Secondly, there was a wide range of variance in scores (for both subjects) across Districts. The demographics that we explored in part 2, such as percentage of students in poverty and percentage of English language learners, all have an effect on test scores (along with other things that are not included in the data). Finally, as the general public is slowly starting to realize, there are many issues with standardized testing and the many negative correlations that we saw in our parallel coordinates plots lend credence to this idea. There is countless research available that details the harmful effects of these tests in an attempt to abolish them altogether. Here is a great place to start reading if you are interested: https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/racist-beginnings-standardized-testing Now, moving to the limitations of our research. Standardized testing is not always the best measure of academic success; we used the two interchangeably in our analysis of the data, because we do not have access to the large scale, quantitative and qualitative data that is necessary to paint the full picture of a student’s academic performance. As mentioned before, the way we viewed race in our analysis was binary and did not leave much room for nuance that exists within the classroom and beyond Looking forward, introducing the school satisfaction survey and integrating it into our analysis of the education that a school/district is provides its students would be interesting. The aforementioned survey can be found here: https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/school-quality/nyc-school-survey The biggest lesson we learned is data cleaning is a long and detailed process that truly shapes your visualizations and analysis. You may have to go back and forth between cleaning/transforming the data and visualizing/analyzing multiple times, if you really want to view your data from as many different perspectives as possible.
