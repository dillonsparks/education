# Proposal
 
## Research topic

Our research topic focuses on the composition of the NYC school system, in addition to the factors of academic success (measured by standardized testing scores). We are aware that there are indications of a school’s ability to impact its students other than standardized testing success (or lack thereof). Anyone familiar with the NYC DOE knows that all public schools do not have the same access to resources and extracurricular activities that shape a child’s learning experience and impact exam performance. Each school in the city is a unique ecosystem that is shaped by its location, the staff/administration, the student body, and the community that surrounds it. The data that we have transformed and analyzed is meant to tell part of the story, not all of it. We hope to provide you with some preliminary insight into the makeup of the NYC public school system, which will inspire you to learn more on your own. 

## Data availability

(Standardized testing scores)
https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/test-results (ELA Test Results 2013-2022, and Math Test result 2013-2022)

For this project, we will be utilizing three datasets: two that include standardized test scores from the New York Department of Education InfoHub and another with student demographics from the NYC DOE. 

The first two datasets contain English Language Arts (ELA) and Math test scores between 2013 and 2022 from students in 3rd grade to 8th grade at every school. Each year, the Department of Education (DOE) shares test results in hopes of  helping “families and educators understand the performance of New York City schools” (NYC InfoHub). Data regarding test results is available at the city, borough, district, and school levels. For this project, we will examine test results at both the school and district levels. The data is updated yearly, however does not include test scores from 2020 and 2021 since exams were not administered or optional due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its format is tabular, thus it can be exported as a spreadsheet or CSV file. The dataset also includes important information such as the number of students tested, mean scale score for the respective subjects, and the level at which each student was tested. This dataset is highly credible given that it comes directly from the NYC DOE.

(Student demographics by School)
https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/school-quality/information-and-data-overview 

This dataset was also collected by the New York City Department of Education (NYC DOE) and it includes various information about a district's/school's student demographics, including race, sex assigned at birth, English language learner status, economic status, and much more. It was collected using the student’s information once they entered the NYC public school system. Due to differences in the timing of when student demographic, address, and census data were pulled, ENI (Economic Need Index) values may vary (2017-18 - 2021-22 Demographic Snapshot). The format of the data is tabular, it can be exported as an excel spreadsheet or CSV file. The data was last updated June 15, 2022. Some additional information about the dataset is that the “New York State Education Department begins administering assessments to be identified as an English Language Learner (ELL) in Kindergarten, but students in Pre-K are still included in the denominator for the ELL calculations” (2017-18 - 2021-22 Demographic Snapshot). Pre-K students also do not receive NYC DOE School food, however are included in the poverty calculations.

We plan to import the data by downloading the six separate datasets, reading them into RStudio, and then joining them based on Year and either School or District (depending on which level the data was collected at). In the end we will have two new datasets, one for school and one for district, each with demographic data and math/ELA test scores for all grades 3-8, between 2017-18, 2018-2019, and 2021-2022.
